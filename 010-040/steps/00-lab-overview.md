# Lab 010-010: The Power of Kagent - Before and After

## 🎯 Lab Overview

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with Kagent! This lab demonstrates the **power of AI-powered Kubernetes troubleshooting** by comparing traditional manual methods with Kagent's intelligent problem-solving capabilities.

## 📊 What You'll Experience

In this lab, you'll:
1. **Manually troubleshoot** 4 common Kubernetes problems (20-25 minutes)
2. **Solve the same problems** using Kagent (2-3 minutes)
3. **Compare the approaches** and see the dramatic time savings
4. **Understand the value** Kagent brings to Kubernetes operations

## 🔍 The Problems We'll Solve

### Problem 1: Pod CrashLoopBackOff
A pod keeps crashing. What's wrong?

### Problem 2: Service Not Routing Traffic
A service exists but traffic isn't reaching the pods. Why?

### Problem 3: Resource Exhaustion
The cluster is running out of resources. Which pods are the culprits?

### Problem 4: HPA Not Scaling Up
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler wants more replicas but can't create them. What's blocking it?


## ✅ Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster access with `kubectl` configured
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts (pods, services, deployments)
- OpenAI API key (for Kagent)
- Helm v3.x installed (for Kagent installation)

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will:
- Experience the pain points of manual Kubernetes troubleshooting
- See how Kagent dramatically reduces troubleshooting time
- Understand common Kubernetes problems and their solutions
- Get excited about what you'll learn in the course
- Appreciate the value of AI-powered operations

# Support Code for Lab 030-030

This directory contains example files and resources for the KMCP Discovery and Exploration lab.

## Files

### `example-mcpserver.yaml`
An example MCPServer resource manifest that demonstrates the structure and fields of an MCPServer resource. This file is used in the lab steps for:
- Understanding MCPServer resource structure
- Dry-run testing of MCPServer creation
- Reference for creating your own MCP servers

**Note**: This is an example file only. The image and configuration are placeholders and should be replaced with actual values when deploying real MCP servers.

## Usage

The example MCPServer file is referenced in:
- Step 4: Understand MCPServer Resource
- Step 5: Verify KMCP Integration

You can use this file as a template when creating your own MCP server deployments in later labs.
